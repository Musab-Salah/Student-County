# Student County

the basic idea is to provide or exchange services between students. The services chosen are for real problems that the student suffers from and have not been solved before. The services are :

1- Books : The student can add his books for sale or exchange or to search for a book that another student has added.

2- Patients : Any student can add a patient to be treated by dental students and any person outside the university can also register to be able to use this service only.

3- Housing : Any student with housing and looking for a partner can add an advertisement in this service.

4- Tools : Students can exchange or sell their tools that they used in the educational process such as engineering drawing equipment etc.

5- Rides : Any student has a private car and has empty seats and wants to accompany students to the university.
